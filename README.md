Repository Name: Ecommerce API using Node.js

# Description:
This repository contains a comprehensive Baking site API built with Node.js, designed to power an online store backend. It offers a wide range of features and functionalities to support your products selling application development like: 
  1- New account registration (either as a Member or as a Baker).
  2- Bakers and Members can authenticate.
  3- Bakers can add new products for selling and then edit or remove them.
  4- All users can list available products and filter them by location and type.
  5- All users can see a baker’s profile (with a rating).
  6- Members can see available collection times and place orders. For collection time availability, assume that each baker can bake only one       cake at a time (see an example in the Appendix).
  7- Bakers can see their orders, accept, reject and fulfil them.
  8- Customers can rate their fulfilled orders. Orders rates form the overall baker’s rating.
  9- All Registered users (Baker or Member) can update thier and reset thier passwords.
